This is a simple Library Management System developed using Java Swing. It provides a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows users to perform basic library functions like add, view, edit, delete, clear and exit operations for book records.

## Features

- Add new book records
- View list of books in a table format
- Edit existing book details
- Delete book records
- Clear text fields
- Exit the application

## Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 8 or above)
- Java Swing (GUI toolkit)
- ActionListener interface for handling button events

## Main Components Used

| Component      | Purpose                              |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| `JLabel`       | To label text fields and buttons     |
| `JTextField`   | To input book details                |
| `JButton`      | To perform actions (add, view, etc.) |
| `JTable`       | To display list of books             |
| `JPanel`       | For layout and design                |
| `ActionListener` | To handle button click events      |

## Core Method: `actionPerformed()`

All button actions are handled using the `actionPerformed()` method. This defines how the application reacts when a user interacts with GUI buttons such as:

- `Add`: Add a new book
- `View`: Display all books in a table
- `Edit`: Modify an existing book's details
- `Delete`: Remove a book from the system
- `Clear`: Reset all text fields
- `Exit`: Close the application
